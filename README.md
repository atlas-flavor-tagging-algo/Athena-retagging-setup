# Athena Retagging Setup

#### Purpose of these scripts:

Setting up Athena with retagging including DL1 in the
FlavourTagPerformance framework, according to
[Valerio's recommendations][1].

#### How to use it:

 1. Start from a new lxplus session.
 2. To create a Athena test area, run

    `source create_TestArea.sh <path-to-test-area>`

    This will create a subdirectory and build the required packages


 3. **Once the test area is already set up**,

    `source setup_TestArea.sh <path-to-test-area>`

    will, when starting another time from a new lxplus session, set up
    Athena in your previously created test area.  Rules for the
    arguments remain the same.

That's it.


###### What this will do:

This will get all the packages required to run retagging with the DL1
tagger using the flavourtagging performance framework, whether using
the setup in the trunk or the branches as described in aforementioned
[recommendations][1].  The packages will automatically be compiled and
the work area will be set up.


###### Details on the provided job options (JO):

Retagging will be [switched on][2] and an xAOD which can be used for a
test run is [defined in a public directory][3] as well.  The JO also
define the number of events to run over with the argument given in

``` jp.AthenaCommonFlags.EvtMax.set_Value_and_Lock(10) ```

Setting the argument to `-1` would corresponds to using all events in
the xAOD. The JOs currently set the number of events to 10.  With the
current Athena settings it is also possible to switch to using a local
NN configuration file (in JSON format with special syntax!) that will
be used by DL1 by [defining it][4].


###### About actually using it in a test run:

In order to run the job, go to `$TestArea/run/` and run `athena
jobOptions_Tag.py`.  The ROOT output file where the retagging ouput is
stored in branches is stored as `$TestArea/run/flav_Akt4EMTo.root`.
